                    <div class="subheading mb-1"><u>C# / DotNet</u></div>
                    <div>
                        As seen elsewhere on my Github repositories you can see that I have decent experience in using C#/DotNet to make programs that run on Windows. I mainly write these programs in Visual Studio Community 2022.
                        My main drive to learn and write C# is that it allows me to write a program that runs directly on Windows with no need for any other workaround.<br>
                        The main reason I initially picked C# as opposed to something like C++ is that C# is a highly managed language which takes out a lot of the mess like segmentation faults. <br>
                        I often get asked: "Why not Java?". The simple answer is that C# compiled binaries normally run on Windows all the time, whereas you can't always count on Java to be up to date and properly installed. <br>
                        C# is my language of choice, which is why I use it for almost all of my solo <a href="#Projects">projects.</a>
                    </div>

                    <div class="subheading mb-1"><u>C# / Unity Game Engine</u></div>
                    <div>
                        I also have spent some time in the Unity Game Engine, despite Unity existing primarily as a game engine it also serves well as a quick and easy place to test C# based 3D rendering and a good place to practice logical object oriented programming environment. <br>
                        I have also used Unity for recreational game development with a few friends, which has shown me that I enjoy helping others learn to program, and enjoy solving problems with a team of people willing to listen. Unfortunately all Unity projects I've been a part of are privated at the request of those on the devleopment team.

                    <div class="subheading mb-1"><u>Unreal 3 / UnrealScript</u></div>
                    <div>Thousands of hours of my life has been spent creating mods for games based in Unreal 3, working in UE3 provides some unique challenges not found in many modern programming languages. 
                        The main problem was the lack of easily accessed documentation which means you can spend hours searching decades old forums for a tiny bit of useful information. While most people including some of my modding team would be heavily discouraged by this slog of a task, 
                        being able to see the end result working is enough for me to push through.<br>
                        Because of the unprotected state of the Steam workshop, any of my UE3 work is kept privated and only accessible to those inside the project. Access to the decompiled code can be requested by email or direct message.

                    <div class="subheading mb-1"><u>Unreal 3 Level Design / Unreal Kismet / Blueprint</u></div>
                    <div>
                        While I've spent a lot of time programming in Unreal 3 I have also spent upwards of a thousand hours repurposing existing models and textures into new environments and levels.<br>
                        Initially this was born out of a desire to modify an existing map to add another window, little did I know less than a year later I would have rebuilt the entire thing from scratch, and continued development on the level for years to come.
                        I continued to work and develop this map, along with a few others, for years to come. It was all I did for a long time. <br>
                        I think my work in this area is relevant, as I believe it shows that I can work with limited resources and can be extremly dedicated to a task.

                    <div class="subheading mb-1"><u>Lua</u></div>
                    <div>Admittedly while not extremly familiar, I have spent a decent amount of time modifying existing Lua for Dota 2 and have found that it taught me a lot about working within very specific environmental constraints
                        and learning how to convert my general knowledge in programming to the language specific variant of what I need. <br>
                        Lua is nothing like the other languages I know well, regardless I thought it was a good learning experience and I am now a lot more comfortable with it than I thought. <br>
                        The main example of my Lua can be found below in the projects/repos section.

                        When I'm not programming something I'm probably playing games with friends.
                        I have found that playing games with friends has helped me learn a lot of skills that apply to other areas of my life. <br>
                        I often end up taking a leadership position when given the opportunity, it has taught me how to deal with people who aren't up to my standards, and how to handle failure with grace.

                    <div class="subheading mb-1"><u>Video Editing</u></div>
                    <div>
                        All the way back in 2011 I bought fraps and starting recording and uploading videos to YouTube. <br>
                        Over the course of a the next 10 years I spent time learning to edit videos on professional software such as Adobe Premiere Pro. While uploading lots of it to my YouTube channels. <br>
                        While my free time to edit videos has significantly slowed since then due to actually having a social life, I still like to find some time to
                        create small compilation videos out of clips of me and my friends. <br>
                        My most popular types of videos I've created are edits of other peoples videos, highlight clips or "best of" type content. Although in the end I stopped making this type of content due to the massive amount of time required
                        for these projects.

                            <p>
                                This small project was created after countless times windows has refused to end a task when I requested. <br>
                                It essentially serves as a gutted, minimal task manager with the advantage that it can end any non-protected task on your pc while the user only has to use an easy to use GUI. <br>
                                One of the main things I tried to do with this project was to make the UI simple and smooth compared to a lot of my previous projects. While this seems fairly simple in concept, I initially hit a massive wall
                                when refreshing the process table as it was taking an extreme amount of time to refresh. This led to me creating a simple custom stopwatch class to debug what exactly was causing the slowdown. <br>
                                This allowed me to find a mistake in my table generation and update code, and improve it to a point where it is over 800 times faster than the original. <br>
                                As of February 2022, this project is in a state where it is both completely usable, but I will continue to work on it to make it better. <br>
                                If the project is considered complete. It will be given a compiled version in the releases page of the repo.

                                As of mid 2022, I have spent a decent amount of time trying to refine the visual side of this project, which is something I rarely due to it being out of my skillset. <br>
                                After this I feel I should attempt any new projects in WPF instead of forms as WPF has much more creative freedom from the restraints that the Win32 wrapper that forms employs.

                               Have you ever wanted to load thousands of images and randomise the viewing order? I have. <br>
                               Every image viewing software I've used has been decent at part of what I want, but completely failed at another part. <br>
                               After years of frustration I decided to make my own, and while it isn't exactly pretty, it is functional. Its lightweight, and has a simple interface. It has web support, it can load videos through axWin support. <br>
                               It is my biggest solo project and has taken hundreds of hours of development. Despite this I don't think it's a complete project. Because of the sensitivity of some parts of the project I have 
                               released the code for a previous version to the public repo. There is also an unreleased private repo used for delicate development. <br>
                               I have stopped working on this project for now, but I will inevitably return to it at some point in the future.

                            <p>
                                I seem to be one of the only people left that enjoys downloading music as mp3 and playing it locally on my computer instead of streaming everything. <br>
                                I also happen to be a big fan of <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/home">osu!</a>, a rhythm game. This means effectively I had thousands of songs on my hdd but there was an issue, because it wasn't intended for direct playback
                                but rather for use in a game, it lacked mp3 metadata. All 15000+ files are simply named "music.mp3". <br>
                                This program gets every file, extracting the metadata from folder paths and other related files and then attaching the metadata to the mp3, renaming it appropriately. <br>
                                It then puts the new file in a folder location of the user's choosing. <br>
                                This project was initially created to run out of command line only, as that is simpler and quicker to develop and debug. As the software ballooned in complexity and the annoyance of
                                copying a file path continued every debug session, I thought it'd be beneficial to not only me, but anyone else who wanted to use this program if I created an accompanying GUI. <br>
                                Overall I consider this project complete in its current state. It does what it needs to do, and I am happy with the results.

                                JPZedternal is a fork of a mod for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/232090/Killing_Floor_2/">Killing Floor 2</a>. <br>
                                This was a 2-6 person project primarily headed by me and <a href="https://github.com/Fleming1924">Dylan Fleming.</a>
                                I initially forked this mod to adjust a few values to allow me and my friends to have a bit more control over our gameplay. After spending a while looking over the code
                                we realised that we could do so much more and from there we spent thousands of hours on this project. This is by far my biggest project to date. Over 400 commits to the repo and
                                I cannot release the uncompiled files publicly as the amount of work we've put in leaves the project open to theft. The link above instead will leave to the steam community workshop page. <br>
                                This project had its ups and downs, sometimes work would pay off and sometimes it wouldn't. In one case I spent 2 months working on a new feature, only for it to come crumbling down in the live release.
                                Forcing a complete reversion of months of work. <br>
                                <s>In the end the project has been archived and will no longer be updated. This is primarily because the base of the project relies on the original game developers, and they consistently break parts
                                of our code with thoughtless updates to the framework.</s> <br>
                                After a small resurgence, I have decided that this project may be worked on again soon, once I have more time and more creativity at hand.

                                One of my simplest projects that actually saw extended use. <br> It's very simple but very effective. <br>
                                If you're a fan of the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/65800/Dungeon_Defenders/">Dungeon Defenders</a> then you'll know that there's times you want to do something else at the same time. 
                                The problem arises that you need to tab back into the window to ready up for each wave. <br>
                                This solves that problem by allowing you to bind a key that when pressed will send the ready up key directly to the game window. <br>
                                As I planned to share this with others I play the game with, I took a little extra time to make it look a bit more presentable.
